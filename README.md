# Classification-of-Housing-data
Using sklearn, in Python. Implementation includes Random forest and XGBoost classifier.


Objective: In this assignment, you have to perform three class classification. Based on the given attributes about houses in a particular county, you have to predict the class in the last column, which is "SaleStatus". For this purpose, you are given training data in the file trainSold.csv, and testing data in the file testSold.csv. The latter has the last column missing, for which you have to generate labels.

Note: Please read the instructions very carefully. If you do not follow them exactly, then your submission will be penalized. Re-evaluation requests because of unmindful deviation from the instructions cannot be entertained due to the large class size.

Learning objectives:
1. Learn to pre-process data. For example, nominal variables need to be converted into groups of Bernoulli, or data range should be normalized.
2. Try different multi-class classification techniques. At least three different ones should be tried.
3. Learn good practices for validation and hyper-parameter tuning, including visualizing the impact of hyper-parameters.
4. Learn about cross-validation.
5. Learn about feature importance.
6. Learn about visualizing the decision boundaries for at least the top two most important features.
